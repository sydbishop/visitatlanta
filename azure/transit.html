                        <p><h4>Atlanta Beltline Eastside Trail</h4></p>
                        <p>Only two miles from the heart of Downtown, the Atlanta Beltline Eastside Trail is an incredibly popular destination for residents and visitors alike. With the exception of about a block, the entire journey can be completed using protected or off-street bike facilities.</p>
                        <p>Take the PATH Parkway, which begins at the intersection of Luckie St. and Baker St. near the Georgia Aquarium. Head east towards the protected cycletrack on John Portman Blvd. Cross Piedmont Avenue and hop onto the off-street Baker Highland Connector Trail.  Turn right at Jackson Street and enjoy one of Atlanta's most iconic vistas from the Jackson Street Bridge. Be mindful of cars in this section! Turn left onto the Freedom Park Trail just before Cain Street. Take the Freedom Park Trail all the way to the Eastside Beltline access point.</p>
                        <p><h4>Westside Beltline Connector Trail</h4></p>
                        <p>While it isn't possible to access the Westside Beltline Trail using only on off-street bike facilities (yet!), the Westside Beltline Connector Trail is still a great ride. This 2.1-mile trail features multiple bridges, a tunnel, and breathtaking views of Downtown Atlanta.</p>
                        <p>Take the PATH Parkway, which begins at the intersection of Luckie St. and Baker St. near the Georgia Aquarium. Head north and then turn left when you get to Ivan Allen Blvd. Head west on Ivan Allen and cross over Northside Dr. The entrance to the Westside Beltline Connector Trail is at the SW corner of Ivan Allen Blvd and Northside Dr.</p>
